# Mermaid Notes Index (This Repo)

These documents are short summaries of upstream Mermaid docs, focused on what we use in this Slidev deck.

## Index

- Flowchart syntax (condensed, for Codex): `docs/mermaid/flowchart.md`
- Flowchart syntax (full upstream copy, for completeness checks): `docs/mermaid/flowchart.upstream.md`

## Project Rules

Project-specific Mermaid rules (security posture, HTML labels, embedding images, and Slidev fences) are kept in `AGENTS.md`.
